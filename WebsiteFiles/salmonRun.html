				<h2 style="padding-left: 25px"> The Problem </h2>
				<p style="padding-left: 25px"> 
				Salmon Run is an eduaction game teaching concepts of hereditary genetics for students of
				various ages. The project was started by Michigan State University's BEACON organization. I
				was brought on as a technical lead to program gameplay and user interface elements. Initially, 
				the project lacked design documentation and had jumbled code.

				<div style="float:right">
					<h2 style="text-align:right; padding-right: 25px;"> My Tools </h2>
					<p style="padding-right: 25px;"> 
					Salmon Run is entirely created via the Unity Game Engine in the C# programming language.
					Additionally, art for the game was created using various softwares like the Adobe Suite and 
					Blender. The design documentation I created for the game was written in Google and Microsoft
					Word.

				<h2 style="padding-left: 25px"> My Plan </h2>
				<p style="padding-left: 25px"> 
				As I joined the project late into the game's development, my plan was to start by working 
				with the team's artist to create formal design documentation which laid out specific requirements 
				and stretch goals for the project. I also began debugging a variety of issues in preparation for 
				a general playtest that would allow us to determine what was currently enjoyed by teachers and students 
				in the game.

				<div style="float:right">
					<h2 style="text-align:right; padding-right: 25px;"> The Execution </h2>
					<p style="padding-right: 25px;"> 
					The design documentation had to wait until after the first playtests of the school year due 
					to deadlines set before school started in Fall 2020. The debugging process was smooth 
					throughout the Fall and into the Spring with various issues including game performance, unit pathfinding, 
					and user interface glitches all being addressed.

				<h2 style="padding-left: 25px"> The Result </h2>
				<p style="padding-left: 25px"> 
				Salmon Run is an ongoing project. Since the time when I was part of the development team, the game 
				has coninued to improve and expand, utilizing the design document I helped author so that new team 
				members are on the same page regarding the direction of the game.
