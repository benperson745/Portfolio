				<h2> My name is Benjamin Person </h2>
				<p> 
				I am a game designer and programmer with a particular interest in 
				telling stories through interlocking mechanical systems the same way 
				many interactive stories have impacted me to want to explore user
				experience as a career. To accomplish this, I have created a number 
				of individual and team projects where I have acted as an 
				interdisciplinary go-between for different members of the team. The 
				reason these projects were successful was in part due to my ability 
				to break development problems down into manageable chunks and integrate 
				each chunk step-by-step as well as communicate these breakdowns for 
				team members with varying technical backgrounds (art, programming, 
				UX, etc.). This ensured that each chunk worked on its own before 
				being added onto by the next chunk. Additionally, the schedule and 
				process for when and how tasks were accomplished were tracked in a 
				number of documents I helped create and maintain.
