# Portfolio
## Purpose
This is a GitHub repository to store the various files I use to create my personal Game Development Portfolio site. This includes:
* Directories containing my case study materials
* Directories containing my preproduction scripting and game design wireframes and documents
* Builds of my various projects and resume for download off of my website
