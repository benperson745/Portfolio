# Portfolio
## Purpose
This is a GitHub repository to store the various files I use to create my personal Game Development Portfolio site. This includes:
* Directories containing my case study materials
* Directories containing my preproduction scripting and game design wireframes and documents
* Builds of my various projects and resume for download off of my website

## Design Thought Process
### Font
I selected 3 fonts for 3 express purposes. I selected "Teko" for my logo and header navigation bar. Teko is the boldest and strongest in terms of line weight and feels very compact due to a relatively low amount of kerning. "Exo" was the font I selected for my headers and section names. It still has a boldness to it to help cordone off sections, but it is clearly a more light-weight sibling to Teko. Finally, I chose "Dosis" for my body text. Across all three of these fonts, my  interest was to keep the site looking tech oriented and each of these fonts seem closely related enough to accomplish that. Their general weight and bearing ensures that they are not mistakeable for more ordinary sans-serif fonts and feel like they belong in a computation space.

### Color Palette
I wanted all  of my colors to be reminiscent of either gaming community spaces or of basic colors associated with many game dev programs. For the first half of that desire, I hovered towards the VOIP app Discord which has a heavy focus on royal purple. The second half of my colors I narrowed down to the rich versions of red, blue, and yellow. These 3 colors are the backdrop to my case study pages with the intent that running from the color red (alarming and problematic) to a cooler blue (calm) will show my processes from problem to solution being particularly successful on an emotional level. The remaining space on the site I wanted to be a form of black and white to avoid highlighting unrelated information. While I am still contemplating selecting a lighter grey rather than a harsh black, I am satisfied with how it is performing in this first draft of the site.

### Images
For this first crack at programming the website, I chose to have few images (mainly because many of the projects I intend to include in the final product rely on those projects being completed which they are not). I mostly have standins for spaces I KNOW will need specific imagery in the future. This is particularly clear on the Case Study page. There is only one version of this page and is currently set to act as a template for all my case studies in future rather than having to remake it every time. The images featured there are mostly standins to get a feeling for space rather than delivering content. Meanwhile, my about page has a headshot image of myself to provide a tangible face to my work.

### Navigation Structure
I kept my vaigation structure simple. Either navigate pages via the navigation bar, or through case study buttons on the main page. The navigation bar highlights the section the user is currently in and is easily able to stay at the top of the screen (I intend to implement sticky positioning to always keep it within the users field of view).
